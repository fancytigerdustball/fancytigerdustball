Hi, I'm fancytigerdustball!

I mostly program with Python because it's the only language I know very well.

I also do a little bit of website-type languages, that is, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I do programming as a hobby, and mostly make simple (but fun!) games. Nothing super serious.

Lots of my repositories on here are unfinished, beta, or whatever you want to call it. (I call it cringe).
